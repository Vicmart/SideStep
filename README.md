Version 0.89S is meant for modern computers with at least a dual-core processor.
Version 0.89C is an optimized version able to run on older machines, though smooth performance is not always guarenteed. 

The source code here is for Version 0.89S, but is not significantly different from the code for Version 0.89C.
